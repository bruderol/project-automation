# Exercise Introduction

**Story / Context:**
* Let's do a continuous integration hackaton and have some fun!
* We implement together the most clever chat system of all times ;-)
* At the end of the day we want to have a well tested chat system that works and is feature complete
* All features need to work together well integrated

**Exercise Goals:**
* Learn how to work with Continuous Integration in a team
* Learn how to work with source control systems and branches
* Learn how to use Git (checkout, commit, push, pull, branching, merging, ...)
* Learn how to work with a Continuous Integration build server (Jenkins)
* Learn how to automate continuous delivery and deployment with Gradle, Jenkins Pipelines and Docker

**Work in Feature Teams:**
* You have to work in **teams of 4-6 developers** for this exercise
* We recommend to work in pairs inside the feature teams!
* Every team gets a **separate team feature branch to work on**. Please take care to only work on that branch!
* You **implement at least one feature per developer pair** directly on the team feature branch.
* For the final realease you will **integrate your team's feature branch with other team's feature branches on the develop branch**.
