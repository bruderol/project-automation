# Exercise 1 - Task 3 - Retro & Wrap Up

Stand together with your feature team and discuss the following points
and summarize your discussion on a flip chart:

**Review & Summarize:**
  * What did you learn today?
  * Sketch the CI process that you just followed in the exercise on a flip-chart to remember it
  * What went well?
  * What was problematic?
  * What are the important rules to follow when working with Continuous Integration in a large team?
  * How often should a developer integrate his work with the central source code repository?
  * When would you use branches in your project?
  * Who should be responsible to merge branches?
  * How often would you recommend to merge branches and when?
  * What are potential problems with long living feature branches?
  * What can you think of that would make sense to typically automate in a CI server to ensure your software's quality?	

**Done?**
* Quickly show your results to a coach/teacher to discuss your outcomes.
* Maybe exchange your outcomes with other teams?

When you're done you can chat with the bots, your colleagues or go home and enjoy the evening :-)
